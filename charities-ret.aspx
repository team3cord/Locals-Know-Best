                                        entrepreneurship. Founded in 1988 as a 501(c)3 nonprofit, WESST has nurtured the entrepreneurial dreams of thousands of New Mexicans
                                         by providing training, technical assistance and access to capital. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Throughout its 25-year history, WESST has focused on providing financial literacy and self-employment training to low-income individuals,
                                         because it simultaneously addresses the need to create jobs and stimulate economic development in a state where microenterprise is one
                                         of the primary sectors of job growth. However, many New Mexicans need intensive training to overcome obstacles to successful 
                                        entrepreneurship. For these individuals, opportunities for success are hampered by poor financial literacy, limited business and
                                         marketing skills, limited access to technical resources, lack of capital and low self-esteem. With affordable and quality training,
                                         micro-entrepreneurship can become a viable route out of poverty — especially for women needing to overcome significant barriers to
                                         employment (e.g., lack of childcare and/or transportation), which can often be alleviated by working from the home.  </p>

                                       for Humanity has completed 55 homes.  </p>

                                    <p>Habitat for Humanity founders had the bold vision of a world where everyone has a decent place to live. Experience and research have shown that when families
                                         become Habitat homeowners, they gain a level of stability that is not possible when living in substandard conditions.  Children remain in their neighborhood 
                                        schools, employment prospects are enhanced, and families become active stakeholders in their neighborhood and community.</p>

	    					    		<p>PNHS is celebrating its 20th Anniversary in 2013.  In order to commemorate this in a permanent way, the leaders of the organization plan to build a covered 
                                            pavilion at Caldwell Park. The pavilion will be a beautiful structure that will add to the aesthetics of the surrounding area and allow local residents to
                                             have a covered space for gatherings and other events. It will facilitate small concerts, performances and cultural events. The area where the pavilion is
                                             built will feature upgraded landscaping and lighting, and grassy berms for seating. Cost of construction is estimated to be $85,000. To date, $72,000 has
                                             been secured through grants and private donations. PNHS is planning to break ground on the pavilion in the Spring of 2014, but to make this a reality,
                                             additional funding is needed.</p>

	       		        	 	    <p>Second Harvest was founded in 1971 as a central warehouse for a handful of emergency food pantries in Spokane, Wash., and is the pioneering
                                             organization that leads the fight against hunger in the Inland Northwest.  </p>

                                    <p>Today, Second Harvest is feeding more people than ever before in the uncertain economy. Partnerships with 250 neighborhood food banks, meal 
                                        centers and other hunger-relief programs make it possible for Second Harvest to provide food to more than 50,000 children and adults each week.</p>

                                    <p>Second Harvest's food bank network spans 21 counties in Eastern Washington and five counties in North Idaho – just over 51,000 square miles. With
                                         distribution centers in Spokane and Pasco, Wash., Second Harvest provides close to 2 million pounds of free food each month throughout its vast
                                         service area. Almost half of that food is nutritious fresh fruits and vegetables – much of which is farm-fresh produce from the agriculturally
                                         rich region.</p>

                                    <p>Second Harvest’s food helps fill the nutritional gap for people in poverty, the working poor, elderly and disabled people on very low fixed
                                         incomes, and children and families in temporary crisis.</p>

	       	        		 	    <p>A community gift from Washington Federal will be stretched a long way to get food to where it’s needed most. A broad base of support from
                                             generous food and financial donors and more than 2,500 volunteers a year help Second Harvest transform every donated dollar into six pounds of 
                                            donated food – about five meals – for hungry people in rural and urban communities in the Inland Northwest.

                                             transform our valley with the message of the Gospel.  Through this collaborative ministry, pastors and churches have determined to look beyond the

                                             ministry’s mission is helping churches help people help themselves. We do this by providing a compassionate, prayerful, non-judgmental atmosphere to
                                             verify and address a client’s needs. We network with local agencies to assist with a client’s need for food, clothing, furniture, rental, and utility 
                                            assistance. We offer referral services for addiction recovery, financial planning, and various counseling needs. We host many annual events — a few of
                                             which are: The Back 2 School Giveaway, Thanksgiving Baskets of Blessings, Life Skills Workshops, All-Valley Worship Services, and a Free Dental Day.

                                             our organization has built 47 homes in the Wenatchee Valley for qualifying families. Homeowners are selected based on their need for adequate housing, ability
                                             to repay a no-profit mortgage, and willingness to partner with Habitat for Humanity. Loan repayments contribute to help build additional homes in our community.
                                             Because Habitat homes are built with volunteer labor and are sold with no-profit, they are affordable for low-income partners.  Habitat for Humanity offers families

                                            and to teach parents English, computer skills, civics and useful school skills to support and encourage their children’s learning so both can be more
                                             successful in life. Simultaneous classes serve adults and children, and workers learn in Growers’ Schools — partnerships between Ready by Five, Growers
                                             and local school districts. Most adult students are too old for K-12 public education, too unschooled and unskilled for community college or technical
                                             school. Schooling also builds skills for parents to support their children’s learning. The adults are Yakima Valley’s work force, vital to our economic
                                             prosperity and stability, the parents of most of our school children and future workforce, and our neighbors. Their children are our school districts’
                                             neediest students. We use GED attainment as a course completion measure for adults and school test scores to measure children’s gains. Interactive
                                             Literacy Activities (ILA) between parents and children are included in our curriculum and typically include a game, a song, or a craft to demonstrate
                                             a literacy skill building activity, a science concept and a math exercise. All show parents how to “learningfully” play with their children and that
                                             teachable moments are present in everyday life. </p>
